# apk-build-organizer
This Gradle task automatically renames APKs with build details like package name, Git branch, build type, version, and timestamp. It also organizes renamed APKs into a "modified" folder while deleting old files. The process runs automatically after any `assemble` task. Easy to set up, but might need tweaks based on your project setup. ðŸš€
